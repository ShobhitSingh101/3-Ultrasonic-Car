# 3-Ultrasonic-Car

 In this project, we do how to make an obstacle-avoiding robot with three ultrasonic sensors.
 Servo motor is used to turn the ultrasonic sensor left and right.
 We used three ultrasonic sensors for that process.
 Also, It included four gear motors and these are controlled using an L293D motor driver shield.
 Finally, all these components are controlled by the Arduino UNO board.
